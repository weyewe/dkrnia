Things to do:

1. Delivery + Finalization => Deduct price. (dont adjust the CoGS price yet)
	Make sure that the StockEntryUsage does its shit. What kind of shit?
	
	On delivery confirmation: 
	1. update the statistic of ready item 
	2. update the statistic of pending delivery ( if goes through sales order ) 

2. Receipt + Number (should be quick)
